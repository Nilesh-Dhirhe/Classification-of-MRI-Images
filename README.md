# Classification-of-MRI-Images

In this project I implemented a multiclass classification model for MRI 
images. The model is designed to classify images into four classes using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The code provided uses the PyTorch 
framework, a popular deep learning library, for constructing and training the neural 
network.
